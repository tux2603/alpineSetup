# alpineSetup
Instructions to setup alpine linux, specifiaclly on the HP Elitebook 850 G6

# Part A: Create a bootable USB and install the base system

1. Get the most recent alpine iso [here](https://alpinelinux.org/downloads/)
2. Flash it to an empty USB drive using something like gnome-disks or rufus
3. Boot to the newly flashed USB and run the `setup-alpine` command. This will start an interactive installation process
4. Most of the options will be self explanatory. When asked what type of disk mode to use, select `sys`. This will install alpine to the harddrive

# Part B: setting up the base system
